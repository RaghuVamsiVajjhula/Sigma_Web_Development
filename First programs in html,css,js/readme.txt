Here in this folder we can see 3 files of html,css,js codes which 
give us some basic understanding of what are the working of these in making
websites.


HTML: This is simply the skeleton of the website.    (CAR CHASIS,DOOR PILLARS)

CSS: All the looks and design is done by using CSS.	(CAR BODY,DESIGN,LOOKS,COLOR )

JavaScript: The functionalities in the websites are added by using Js.	(ENGINE,SUSPENSION,GEARBOX,EXHUAST....)
