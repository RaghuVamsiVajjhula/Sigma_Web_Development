We use shadows in css in order to give visually shadows to some elements.

we use box-shadow.

it can have values of 

h-offset:Determines shadow in horizontal position
v-offset:Determines shadow in vertical position

blur: The larger the value the blurrier the shadow is.
spread:Expands or shrinks the shadow size.
color:To define the shadow color.
inset:Makes the shadows inner.

The syntax and meaning of the code is explained in the code 
for box shadows.(index.html)

The text shadow can also be made from css.



OUTLINES:
outlines are lines which can be drawn around the elements,outside the borderes 
to make elements "stand out".

Syntax:
outline: width style color;

The main difference btw border and outline is 
Border stays inside and outline stays outside the box present in our webpage.

outlines dont take up any space they are just drawn arouns the elements.

By using the outline offset property we can increase the size or distance
present in betweeen the ouline lines for a particlular element.
