There are 3 ways to add CSS in HTML:
1.Inline CSS
Here we use style attribute in HTML page.

2.Internal CSS
It means add style tag and place the HTML pages style within.

3.External CSS
Here create a .css file and place all your styles inside that .css file
This is the most used in CSS.


The difference btw inline and internal css:

let us assume we have 10 h1 tags .
If you use inline css for each and evey h1 tag you need to add style attribute
and give them their value.

If you use internal css then for all the h1 tags under the style tag in head 
you can give its functionalities for all the 10 h1 tags at a time.

so suppose we use inline css and wrote the functionalities of all h1 tags.
if there is a need to change some functionality we need to change it for each and 
every tag written.

// end of differnece btw inline and internal.

Why should we use EXTERNAL CSS?
If we write our elements and their functionalities inside the style tag written in
head of html.Our style tags gets increased.. So instead of writing all the styles
inside the HTML. WE can actually write styles separately.
