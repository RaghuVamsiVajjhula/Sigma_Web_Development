We know that we have an TITLE tag which is given in the html code.
The name which you give to the title in the code is not seem inside the website but
it is seen on the top of the tab bar like near the tab close option......





There will be 2 types of tags in HTML:

1.Self Closing Tag: They dont need any special closing tag.
	Example: Meta tag is a closing tag

2.Paired Tag: They need a tag in order to close.
	Example: Html tag is Paired tag and it needed to be closed.
