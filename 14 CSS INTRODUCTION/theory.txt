CSS stands for cascading style sheets.
We use this in order to visualisation of out HTML in better way.

We have selectors in  CSS which will help us to select any element.

If we write a code in HTML:

<div> Hello World </div>

In css we can write:

div                  //This is the selector.
{
    color:red;       //This is our decalration
}
Here color is property and red is its value. 

All the div element present in the html will be effected.

All the conditions written in style sheet element will effect all the tags
like above the div tag.All the div tags are effected with these changes.

We can see that we wrote 2 div tags and 1 span tag.
The conditions written in style are only effecting our div tag
our span is not effected.We need to write another code like:
span{
    color:....  
}
In order to change styles of span tags.

WE added a p tag and placed it next to div in style.
So all the changes are also made to p.
