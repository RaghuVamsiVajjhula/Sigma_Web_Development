Flex Grow:

By default we have the value of the property 
flex-grow :0;

On setting it to some value:

Like if there are 5 elements (here boxes are elemets)
Then they will be taking their own spaces.
If u set the flex-grow property of a particular element
or box to 2 then one element will grow its size to two 
element's size.



Flex Shrink:
It is the ability of an flex item to shrink if necessary.
If u set an element;s flex shrink property to 2 then it can be small if the page
size if reducing up to the value.

Setting value of flex shrink to 2 means that with double speed it shrinks.


align-self:
You can set the align-self for a particlular element in the CSS.
the value can be: flex-start or flex-end.
It means that at the starting of flex the element is aligned.
or 
It means that thge end of the flex element is placed.
