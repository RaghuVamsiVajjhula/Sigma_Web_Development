cascade algorithm:

1.the style written in the latest like in our example there are multiple background colors given to same
h1 tag.
But only the color used in the last of the style like here we gave the purple color in the last so we can see
our h1 tag in the purple color instead of yellow and red colors.

2.Specificity:an algorith which matches among the css selectors.
The priority order for Specificity is:

InlineStyles>Id selectors>Class or Attributes>Element selector>Universal selector


Attribute selector will be like data-x="a" so u can use html when needed by using the attribute selector.


SPECIFICITY VALUES:

Universal selector:0
Element selector or pseudo selector:1
Class selector,Attribute selector and pseudo classes:10
ID selector:100
Inline styles:1000

Then add the values when used together.
Like here in the index.html we have use h1.yellow so here both
Class selector and Element selector have been used at time so the 
Specificity will be 10+1= 11.

we can add like color:red !important which will make the value of Specificity
upto 10,000. overwriting the value will be difficult if value is 10000
