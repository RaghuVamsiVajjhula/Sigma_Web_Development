Inline elements takes that amount of width which is only required.
ex: a tag, span tag.

Block elements the entire width present in that line.
So the next content present in the code is displayed below this.
ex: p tag, div tag.

AS BLOCK elements take the entire width when u write a block element in under an 
inline element it cannot stay in some line.

Here we added span and a tag and we can see that both are in the same line..
So the width is shared in inline element.

Now we saw that the p,div,..... tags are block element and 
a,span,...  are inline elements. But they cant be always same.
We can change their display properties from CSS.
