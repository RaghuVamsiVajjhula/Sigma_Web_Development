transform,filter or perspective are 3 properties which can also 
make an element appear as positioned.
even position for parent is not set then if even one of the above
property is used in parent class it acts as a positioned element.

And the child class workd related to parent class not  the html class.


Positioned element is an element which is having a value like
Relative,absolute, or something wxcept static.


STATIC POSITION:
Position is a property in CSS. Which will be having a value of 
static by default.

Here in our web page we can see that there are 4 boxes which are created.

top,bottom,left,right,z index cannot be set when the value of the
Position is by default set to static.

RELATIVE POSITION:
Here we can see that the Position of box2 is made to be RELATIVE.
(you can check comment in box1 and comment in box2)

ABSOLUTE POSITION:
If there is a child class and parent class in our code.

Also here parent class is a box and child class is another box of parent class.


If u set child class to absolute and give it some style like top=0;
so child class will need to move up.

Here when we the child class is positioned and parent class is not positioned then the
child class will be set positioned directly to the HTML .

It means the child box will be placed at top of HTML page.It even overlaps the parent class.

So if parent class is positioned then the child class will stay top inside the parent box.
