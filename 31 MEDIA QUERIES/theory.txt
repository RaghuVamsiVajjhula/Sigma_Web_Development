In order to make a website responsive, we need to use media queries.

Responsive in the sense that the website looks good in a computer and a mobile also.

So the syntax will be:

@media only screen  
screen is used for devices having screens.


(@media)  (only or not)  (mediatype) and (expressions)
{
    CSS code.
}
