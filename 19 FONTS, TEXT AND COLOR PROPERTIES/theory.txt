There are multiple fonts available in our VS code which can be added to our website.
But u need to add a generic font family which is available in all the user devices.

Inside font family:" " There are multiple fonts written Inside.
This is because the first font written in the family will be the MAIN FONT.

The reamaining fonts written after to these fonts are the FALLBACK fonts.
They are used when the main font is available to work.
