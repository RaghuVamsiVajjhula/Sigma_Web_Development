Box model in CSS:
There are mostly 3 components under Box model:
Margin,Border,Padding.
The detail about the placement of these 3 components and setting them 
is explained in Box Model in Css.

In Css all the elements which we use under HTML are considered as boxes.

We can give an element, multiple classes.

Also here we made margin and padding to 0 where all 
the default values given by browser are made to 0.

Also when there are 2 consitions which are styled for a tag
the condition which which is specified seperately is 
only considered.

Example:

<div class="box one">...........</div>
<div class="box two">...........</div>

When u specify a style to .box it will not be implemented when
.one and .two are specified.

THE BOX MODEL TELLS THAT:

The structure of the box model is like in the 
BOX MODEL.png (image )

margin,padding and borders are specified for
box 1 in index.html 

There is another concept called MARGIN collapse.

Here assume we have 2 boxes in our webpage and you have given

25px margin space for 1st box.
25px margin space for 2nd box.

Now when u check the space in btw 2 boxes: 
You have to get 50px of empty space because space for 1st box is 25 and 2nd is also 25.

But here we can get a space only of 25px.

Becasue the concpet of margin collapse tells that if there are 2 
boxes and they have their own spaces.

so the space in between them will be, The spaces given to each boxes are
compared and the greatest one will be taken and implemented.

If box1 have 35px and box2 have 25px. The space btw 2 boxes will be 35px.
