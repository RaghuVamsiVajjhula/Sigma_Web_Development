There are some inline elements and block elements in HTML.

As we know that the span tag is an inline element so we get the below 2 lines of span in same lines


Block elements like div will not continue another line next to it.

Inline element like span will print the next line next to it.

We can add a display property like:
display:inline in order to make a block element into inline and
make it print in the  same line.

If u give padding property to any inline element then the
padding-top will not be showing its property.

Same the margin will not include the margin-top property for the 
inline elements.

Also the width cannot be set for an class with display property set to inline.
