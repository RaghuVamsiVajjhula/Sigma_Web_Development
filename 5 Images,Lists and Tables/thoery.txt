Here in order to addd an image we use 

img src="" and alt=""

Here the src contains the filename.png  and 
the alt attribure consists of the text which is to be displayed on the
website when image cannot be displayed due to some error.

Now we add width="" attribute with some value like 230 or something....
230 is a good size here so we used it.

Also width is defined in html as an Inline CSS element.

Generally it is described in css  and in the form of px;

example:  width:230px;

Also we can add height  attribute
Even height can be added in CSS


Table tags are very useful

It consists of 

tr tag: table row.
th tag: table heading.
td tag: table data.

You can add multiple td so that the number of rows in the table 
increases.
You get it in the form of data elements.

By default the table looks ugly like there will be no borders on the 
table and there is no proper arrangement of elements in the table.


Inside the <td> we can add colspan="" attribute which means that 
it td value will take the number of coloumuns given to colspan attribute.

Inside the <td> we can also add rowspan="" attribute which works same as colspan
but it row's directon.


Also we can add captions in HTML and its font and style can be defined further.

The header and footer can also be added to the table
with <thead> and <tfoot>
Also the body content of the tabel is also added with tbody.


The  br tag which is used to break.

There are lists in html which are of 3 types:
Unordered lists.
Ordered lists.
Definition lists.

In unordered lists the data is written in <li> element(li : list items)
also the data which is entered is given in an non ordered form 
like there are no proper arrangement like below:

Un ordered lists are not like the below syntax!!
1....
2....
3....

They are not numbered and unorganised
In unordered lists we get our data in bullet points and we can customise the bullet by 
using type="" attribute.


Ordered lists are organised we can see them organised:
1...
2...
3...
In ordered lists we can also use type attribute to specify wheather
type=1(numebers),I(roman numbers),a(Lowercase),A(uppercase)


Defintion lists use 3 tags:
<dl>definition list
<dt>definition term
<dd>definition definition

It's like,
