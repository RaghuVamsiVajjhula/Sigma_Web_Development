If we make a website without using variables, So now if we needed to change the colors in our website.
For example we have made our website in dark theme so black is a color we have used multiple number of
times in our website.We have to select each and every color and change it it may take a long time to change
colors for multiple times.

So if we declare a variable and set a variable name with one color and whenever we need to use some color
we can use the variable name in place of color.

We also need to declare our variable in global declaration.

There is also declaration of local variable.

If a variable is not found then we can give a fallback color.

ALSO
we can give the color variable to set the borders:
example:  2px solid var(FirstColor)


CSS variables can also hold some other prooperties other than
colors.


THE variables can store 
background,URL's,Strings,numbers and more..
